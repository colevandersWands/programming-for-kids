Spend the rest of the day playing.

## [DAY-56] Basics of Basics

Trivia game

```
def check(question, answer):
    x = input(question + ": ")
    if x == answer:
        return True
    else:
        return False


score = 0
if check("which animal lives on the north pole?", "polar bear"):
    score += 1
if check("which animal lives in the jungle?", "tiger"):
    score += 1

print("your score is: " + str(score))
```

Math test:

```
import random

while True:
    a = random.randint(1,10)
    b = random.randint(1,10)

    r = int(input("what is " + str(a) + " * " + str(b) + "? " ))

    if r == a * b:
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect, the answer was: " + str(a * b))
```

Random characters

```
import random

while True:
    x = random.randint(ord('a'), ord('z'))
    print(chr(x))
```

```

## [DAY-58] Basics of Basics

Keep working on the snake game if you are not done. if you are do touch typing

## [DAY-59] Basics of Basics

Tuples are kind of like lists that you cant grow or shrink, but also you usually assign meaning to each of the positions, for example

```
position = (1,2)

(x,y) = position
print(x)
print(y)
```

it can have more elements

```
posittion = (1,2,3)
(width,depth,height) = position

print(width)
print(depth)
print(height)
```

You see how we used it in the snake game, to make a list of tuples, where we had the player history.

```
positions = [(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)]
print(positions)
for p in positions:
    print(p)
    (x,y) = p
    print(x)
    print(y)
```

It is quite handy when you know you have pairs of data, like X and Y position or Season number and Episode number.

```
favorite_miraculous = [(3,1),(3,2),(2,1)]

for m in favorite_miraculous:
    (season,episode) = m
    print(str(season) + " season episode: " + str(episode))
```

Or more than 2 pieces, you can hold however many you want, but it usually is you that assign meaning to each position, like in the above case, the first element we decide is season, and the second one we decide is episode

## [DAY-60] Basics of Basics

Back to the beginning.

* Write a program to make a spy name
